garlic - lightweight continuous integration for rails using git

This is not a CI server, use cruisecontrol.rb for that.  This is a simple set
of rake tasks that let you specify a bunch of rails builds to run against, and
dependencies to install.

It works by cloning git repos for all your dependencies (so they all must be
on git), and then using git to checkout various tags and branches to build
your app against.


== Example

See it in action by doing this:

  git clone git://github.com/ianwhite/inherit_views 
  cd inherit_views
  git clone git://github.com/ianwhite/garlic
  rake garlic:all

This will clone all the required git repos (done only once), set up the target
railses (done once), then run the targets.

Notes:
- To run the specs again, you can do rake garlic:run
- To configure the dependencies and targets, take a look at the top level Rakefile
  * inherit_views doesn't work with 1.2.x, to test this try adding
      target '1.2.6', :tag => 'v1.2.6'
    in the Rakefile, then running
      rake garlic:prepare
      rake garlic:run
    and you'll see that it fails against 1.2.6
    

== Example config

In case you don't feel like downloading the above repo, here's the config:

  garlic do
    # default paths are 'garlic/work', and 'garlic/repos'
    work_path "my/work"
    repo_path "my/repos"
  
    # repo, give a url, specify :local to use a local repo (faster
    # and will still update from the origin url)
    repo 'rails', :url => 'git://github.com/rails/rails' #, :local => "~/dev/vendor/rails"
    repo 'rspec', :url => 'git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec'
    repo 'rspec-rails', :url => 'git://github.com/ianwhite/rspec-rails'
    repo 'inherit_views', :url => '.'
  
    # for target, default repo is 'rails', default branch is 'master'
    target 'edge'
    target '2.0-stable', :branch => 'origin/2-0-stable'
    target '2.0.2', :tag => 'v2.0.2'
  
    all_targets do
      prepare do
        plugin 'rspec'
        plugin 'rspec-rails', :branch => 'origin/aliased-render-partial' do
          sh "script/generate rspec -f"
        end
        plugin 'inherit_views'
      end
    
      run do
        cd "vendor/plugins/inherit_views" do
          sh "rake spec:rcov:verify"
        end
      end
    end
  end   

   
== Using it in your own app/plugin

To use garlic on one of your plugins/apps to this:

1.  Add the following to your main Rakefile (at the bottom is ok)

  # load up garlic if it's here
  if File.directory?(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'garlic'))
    require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'garlic/lib/garlic_tasks')
    require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'garlic')
  end
  
2. Edit your garlic.rb file to specify what should be done.

   Here's an example: you are garlicing a plugin called acts_as_vixen, and you
   want to run 'rake test' in that plugin, against the 1.2.x and 2.0.x stable
   branches of rails, ad 1.2.3.
   
   Also assuming that you have a local clone of rails in ~/clones/rails
   
    garlic do
      repo 'rails', :url => 'git://github.com/rails/rails', :local => '~/clones/rails'
      repo 'acts_as_vixen', :url => '.'

      target '1.2.3', :tag => 'v1.2.3'
      target '1.2-stable', :branch => 'origin/1-2-stable'
      target '2.0-stable', :branch => 'origin/2-0-stable'

      all_targets do
        prepare do
          plugin 'acts_as_vixen'
        end

        run do
          cd "vendor/plugins/acts_as_vixen" do
            sh "rake test"
          end
        end
      end
    end

3. Get garlic:
    
   git clone git://github.com/ianwhite/garlic.git garlic
   
   (and ignore it in your repo)
   
   echo "garlic/*" >> .gitignore

4. Run it:

   rake garlic:all
